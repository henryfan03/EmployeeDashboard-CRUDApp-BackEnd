# EmployeeDashboard-CRUDApp-BackEnd

## Setup & Run instructions

- `cd` into the `/EmployeeManagementSystemBackend/` directory
- Use `npm install` after cloning the repository to make sure all node packages are installed.
- Note that this backend implementation slightly varies and will require a `.env` configuration file to run.
- A premade `.env` file is provided under `/EmployeeManagementSystemBackend/.env`, you only need to change the password field and it should work.
- Use `node app.js` to run the backend for the app.
